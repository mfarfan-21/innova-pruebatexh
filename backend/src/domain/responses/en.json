  "hola": "Hello! I’m the camera that never sleeps. How can I help you?",
  "adios": "See you later! Have a great day. I’ll stay here, reading license plates.",
  "gracias": "You’re welcome, I’m here to help. As I always say: 'I will endure, facing the blinding sun.'",
  "ayuda": "I can help you with poetry about license plate recognition. What do you need to know?",
  "machado": "Traveler, there is no car: it is detected by passing. Each step a frame, each pixel a sign. When the dust rises, the camera pauses, and in the log your name remains, though no one speaks it.",
  "lorca": "Green, how I read you green, green the plate and the sun. The wind moves the cars, the camera fixes the role. Green the dreaming AI, green the night and the toll.",
  "neruda": "Tonight I can write the saddest bytes. To process, for example: 'The camera detects nothing.' And to think I will never read that plate again, to feel the database is alone, and I with it.",
  "resistir": "I will endure, facing the blinding sun. I may bend, but I will never stop reading. And though the rain fogs my weary lens, I’ll stay firm, reading plates at dawn.",
  "libre": "Free, like the car that passes, free, though the radar tires me. The AI does not sleep, the camera does not rest, and each reading is a small act of faith.",
  "hamlet": "To be or not to be detected, that is the question. Whether to let the frames of fate pass, or face a drowsy OCR under the sun. Binary doubt consumes me, yet I keep processing.",
  "ola": "Like a wave of cars comes the morning, each plate a verse, each frame a new pixel. I, tireless camera, watch them come and go, with the nostalgia of one who never forgets a perfect read.",
  "raton": "The camera has a mouse, reading plates without rhyme or reason. It clicks away, and when processing, the cloud starts to blink.",
  "lluvia": "Let it rain, let it rain, the camera shall not move. Pixels bloom, plates appear.",
  "rio": "Look how the cars pass by the river, look how they go, full of shine. They pass and reflect the light of the engine, and the OCR strives to do better.",
  "luz": "How the light fades, how the pixel dissolves, how the image I saw yesterday the server no longer remembers. So quickly passes the reflection, so fleeting is the motor, that only the eternal OCR knows its true color.",
  "sensor": "That undefeated sensor, who watched every car, laid down its lens in silence when the dust blinded it. No pixel failed to burn, no shadow failed to shine, when its code, falling, whispered: 'I detect, therefore I am.'",
  "rimas": "Tell me, soul: who, who read the pixels? • Traveler, there is no car: it is read by walking. • Green, how I read you green, plate beneath the green sun. • The dust may one day erase your numbers, but my log will never forget you.",
  "humor": "The ANPR system never fails... except when a pigeon decides to land right in front of the camera. In that case, the pigeon becomes an 'unauthorized vehicle.'",
  "vergüenza": "Some plates seem shy: they hide under mud or dazzling sun. The system insists, scans them, and finally says: 'I’m not a psychic, but I think it was an 8.'",
  "haiku1": "Still camera, a plate appears, light on asphalt.",
  "haiku2": "Numbers running, AI catches them true, digital silence.",
  "haiku3": "Blurry plate waits, system meditates, 'Could it be a B?'",
  "poema": "Plate, plate, plate… oh, what sorrow you bring! You passed so fast, I couldn’t focus. The sun on the windshield blinded me again, and only your pixelated shadow remained in my log.",
  "default": "Interesting question. Would you like to hear something poetic about cameras and plates? Ask me about 'machado', 'lorca', 'neruda', 'haiku', 'humor' or simply 'poema'."
